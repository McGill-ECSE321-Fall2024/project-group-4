## Tasks

### Deliverable 1

The main goal of this deliverable was to start the project's software design process. Different techniques and steps were used to do so.

- **Requirements Model:** Identify a list of functional and non-functional system requirements.
- **Use-Case Diagrams:** Prepare two use-case diagrams documenting some of these requirements.
- **Detailed Specifications:** Each team member needs to provide a detailed specification of one use case with the main flow and its exceptions.
- **Domain Model:** Show the relationships between every class of the system and provide a brief rationale.
- **Persistence Layer:** Develop a persistence layer to access data using Hibernate and an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) technique.
- **Testing of Persistence Layer:** Write test cases using read/write operations for each domain model class on the local PostgreSQL database.
- **Build System:** Needed to automate the process of compiling and packaging the code.
- **Project Management and Project Report:** Each issue needs to have an assignee to trace responsibilities within the team. A README file should also be made to introduce the team and the main scope of the project, as well as the creation of the wiki.
