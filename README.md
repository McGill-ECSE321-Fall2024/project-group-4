# Game Shop Online Store

## Scope of The Project

Our team has been tasked with creating a fully functional web application for an independent game shop's online store. Throughout the project, we will also be delivering documentation that includes all of the software development process and procedures. A local database will be used to store important information for the application.

**The application must support a seamless experience for every stakeholder**
- The Owner: Manage all accounts, create/deactivate employee accounts, approve new game requests (update of the game catalog), and respond to customer reviews.
- Employees: Request new games (update of the game catalog), review refund requests, and view customer accounts (email, physical address, username, order history, wishlist). 
- Customers: View the game catalog, add/remove games into their cart, add/remove games to their wishlist, rate games they have bought out of 5, open a refund request, and view their order history.

  All accounts must be able to login with a username and password.

## Tasks

### Deliverable 1

The main goal of this deliverable was to start the project's software design process. Different techniques and steps were used to do so.

- **Requirements Model:** Identify a list of functional and non-functional system requirements.
- **Use-Case Diagrams:** Prepare two use-case diagrams documenting some of these requirements.
- **Detailed Specifications:** Each team member needs to provide a detailed specification of one use case with the main flow and its exceptions.
- **Domain Model:** Show the relationships between every class of the system and provide a brief rationale.
- **Persistence Layer:** Develop a persistence layer to access data using Hibernate and an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) technique.
- **Testing of Persistence Layer:** Write test cases using read/write operations for each domain model class on the local PostgreSQL database.
- **Build System:** Needed to automate the process of compiling and packaging the code.
- **Project Report:** A README file should also be made to introduce the team, the main scope of the project, and individual efforts (in hours). The project wiki should also be visible.
- **Project Management:** Creation of communication channels (Discord, Instagram). Each issue needs an assignee to trace responsibilities within the team.

### Deliverable 2
- **Implementation of Backend Services:** Cover use-cases and create/update/delete/get methods via RESTful API.
- **Software quality plan:** Define test coverage, challenges, and other quality assurance (code reviews, coding conventions, static analysis tools).
- **Unit testing of backend services:** Develop a test suite for the use cases using the JUnit framework.
- **Integration testing of backend services:** Demonstrate successful execution of REST APIs.
- **Build system:** Needed to automate the process of compiling and packaging the code.
- **Project management and report:** Include README file, project wiki, GitHub issues, backlog and milestone.

### Deliverable 3
- **Implementation of Web Frontend:** Provide a graphical user interface for web frontend, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Integration of Web Frontend with Backend Services:** asynchronous calls to backend services via RESTful APIs from deliverable 2.
- **Build system:** Needed to automate the process of compiling and packaging the code.
- **Project management and report:** Include README file, project wiki, Github issues, backlog and milestone.
